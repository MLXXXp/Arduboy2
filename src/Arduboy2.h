  /** \class Print
   * \brief
   * The Arduino `Print` class is available for writing text to the screen
   * buffer.
   *
   * \details
   * For an `Arduboy2` class object, functions provided by the Arduino `Print`
   * class can be used to write text to the screen buffer, in the same manner
   * as the Arduino `Serial.print()`, etc., functions.
   *
   * Print will use the `write()` function to actually draw each character
   * in the screen buffer, using the library's `font5x7` font.
   * Two character values are handled specially (and thus the font symbols that
   * they represent can't be displayed):
   *
   * - ASCII newline or line feed (`\n`, 0x0A, inverse white circle).
   *   This will move the text cursor position to the start of the next line,
   *   based on the current text size.
   * - ASCII carriage return (`\r`, 0x0D, musical eighth note).
   *   This character will be ignored.
   *
   * See:
   * https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/print/
   *
   * Example:
   * \code{.cpp}
   * int value = 42;
   *
   * arduboy.println("Hello World"); // Prints "Hello World" and then moves the
   *                                 // text cursor to the start of the next line
   * arduboy.print(value);       // Prints "42"
   * arduboy.print('\n');        // Moves the text cursor to the start of the next line
   * arduboy.print(78, HEX);     // Prints "4E" (78 in hexadecimal)
   * arduboy.print("\x03\xEA");  // Prints a heart symbol and a Greek uppercase omega
   * \endcode

   *
   * The Arduboy logo scrolls down from the top of the screen to the center
   * while the RGB LEDs light in sequence.
   *
   * This function is the same as `bootLogo()` except the logo is printed as
   * text instead of being rendered as a bitmap. It can be used to save some

   * to display text. However, the logo will not look as good when printed as
   * text as it does with the bitmap used by `bootLogo()`.
