    /** \brief
     * Allow upload when the bootloader "magic number" could be corrupted.
     *
     * \details
     * If the UP button is held when this function is entered, the RGB LED
     * will be lit and timer 0 will be disabled, then the sketch will remain
     * in a tight loop. This is to address a problem with uploading a new
     * sketch, for sketches that interfere with the bootloader "magic number".
     * The problem occurs with certain sketches that use large amounts of RAM.
     *
     * This function should be called after `boot()` in sketches that
     * potentially could cause the problem.
     *
     * It is intended to replace the `flashlight()` function when more
     * program space is required. If possible, it is more desirable to use
     * `flashlight()`, so that the actual flashlight feature isn't lost.
     *
     * \see Arduboy2Base::flashlight() boot()
